# pointless-sudoku-solver
this is a pointless sudoku solver. pointless because it is needlessly complex. It uses the patterns humans use to some sudokus and I now have a much better version that solves it using basically trial and error. but here it is because im still proud of it and it was something really fun to do on a weekend. actaully the last project I did before going into AI.
