# pointless-sudoku-solver
this is a pointless sudoku solver. pointless because it is needlessly complex. I started this project because I fancied a girl at my sixth form who liked sudoku's and I wanted to impress her. It uses the patterns humans use to some sudokus and I now have a much better version that solves it using basically trial and error. but here it is because im still proud of it and it was something really fun to do on a weekend. actaully the last project I did before going into AI.


## controls
all you have to do is select a cell (either by clicking or navigation using arrow keys) and type the numeric value of that cell (obviously leaving the blank ones blank) then press enter. it only takes a few seconds to solve, if it takes more than about 15 seconds then the sudoku is too dificult for the program (it can solve https://sudoku.com/ easy, medium and hard but not expert all the time)

if you want to solve expret ones see my other sudoku repo

I didn't get the girl
